# Travel Advisor
Final Project of ironHack BootCamp

# How to use

We have some folder where you can find the code, the final database and the final presentation with the insights and explanation about the projectl.

# The Code
The "Final Project - Travel Recommendations.ipynb" is the notebook that I worked to get all my data and results. In detail, what I have in the file:

-Import all libraries that I will use.

-City dataset - that I used to create a list to use in my API.

-Country information dataset.

-Weather API - I made many requests on the Weather API, so I create 10 data frames, with all days and features.

-Create a unique table and change some abject types to numbers.

-Join the table with all country information

-Group by month and calculate the averages 

-Did the data to predict

-Scale my numbers

-Used visualization to choose the best K number

-Calculated the scores

-Test other models, but in the end used the Kmeans

-Test other scalers

-Create the final table

-Update my travel function to get the cluster results

-Used the API from skyscanner to get the flights

-Build the travel outputs.
